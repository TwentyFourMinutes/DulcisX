DulcisX translates to _Sweet Extension_ and this is the goal for this Project. It allows you to get your extension done faster and doesn't bother you with ugly or missing API's.

## About

This package aims to wrap around the current Visual Studio SDK. In order to fully achieve this goal, your help is really apricated, since this is everything else than a small Task to do. 

## Installation

For now you will need to compile and build the project yourself in order to use it. Later on, after some testing has been done and the most basic API's are covered it will be published on nuget.org.
