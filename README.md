DulcisX translates to _Sweet Extension_ and this is the goal for this Project, making the experience of developing Visual Studio Extensions sweat. It allows you to get your extension done faster and doesn't bother you with ugly or missing API's.

## About

This package aims to wrap around the current Visual Studio SDK. In order to fully achieve this goal, your help is really apricated, since this is everything else than a small Task to do. 

How you can help? This can be done in numerous ways, over on the issue section, such as:

- Creating feature requests
- Reporting bugs
- Creating pull requests
- Informing about missing documentation/API's

### Collaboration

If you want to collaborate on this project more than creating issues and PR's, feel free to contact me on any of the mentioned contacts at the bottom of the file.

## Stay up to date

If you want to see what is currently planned and being worked on, head over to the projects [Trello](https://trello.com/b/wHTa9Vb8/dulcisx) board. 

## Installation

For now you will need to compile and build the project yourself in order to use it. Later on, after some testing has been done and the most basic API's are covered, it will be published on nuget.org.

## Notes

If you feel like something is not working as intended or you are experiencing issues, feel free to create an issue. Also for feature requests just create an issue. For further information feel free to send me a [mail](mailto:office@twenty-four.dev) to `office@twenty-four.dev` or message me on Discord `24_minutes#7496`.
