# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation, there are a few requirements your skills should meet.

- Pretty solid understanding of C#, if not take a look at the [C# Programming Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/)

- Basic understanding of how Visual Studio Extensions work, otherwise you should take the [First Extension Guide](../getting_started/first-extension.md) which will teach you some basics.

In the guides section you can find information on how to install DulcisX and articles which help you to get started.
