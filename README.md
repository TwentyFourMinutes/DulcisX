DulcisX translates to _Sweet Extension_ and this is the goal for this Project, making the experience of developing Visual Studio Extensions sweat. It allows you to get your extension done faster and doesn't bother you with ugly or missing API's.

## About

This package aims to wrap around the current Visual Studio SDK. In order to fully achieve this goal, your help is really apricated, since this is everything else than a small Task to do. It also tries to document already existing, but hidden or hard to find API's, which are provided by Microsoft.

How you can help? This can be done in numerous ways, over on the issue section, such as:

- Creating feature requests

- Reporting bugs

- Creating pull requests

- Informing about missing documentation/API's

### Collaboration

If you want to collaborate on this project more, than creating issues and PR's, feel free to contact me on any of the mentioned contacts at the bottom of the file.

## Installation

You can either get this package by downloading it from the NuGet Package Manager built in Visual Studio, in the [releases](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/DulcisX/releases) tab or from the official [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DulcisX) website.

Also you can install it via the **P**ackage **M**anager **C**onsole:

Please note, that the package is currently in the pre-release state. This indicates that the version is not yet production ready.

## Documentation

DulcisX provides a better and more detailed overview over the Visual Studio SDK. It hoists things such as Helper and Utility Classes, varies enums and other interesting stuff, which is hard to find on the official Microsoft Documentation.
